## Introduction
Data Structures is about how data can be stored in different structures. Algorithms is about how to solve different problems, often by searching through and manipulating data structures. Understanding DSA helps in using large amounts of data to solve problems efficiently.

## What are Data Structures?
A data structure is a way to store data. The choice of data structure depends on the type of data and the operations we want to perform.

### Family Tree Example
Consider a family tree as a data structure for storing data about people we are related to. It helps in easily finding relationships, such as determining one's grandmother.

Data structures allow us to manage large amounts of data efficiently, which is essential for applications like large databases and internet indexing services.

### Types of Data Structures
- **Primitive Data Structures**: Basic structures provided by programming languages, e.g., integers, floats, characters, booleans.
- **Abstract Data Structures**: Higher-level structures built using primitive data types, e.g., arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs.

## What are Algorithms?
An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a specific problem or achieve a goal.

### Pommes Frites Recipe Example
A cooking recipe is an example of an algorithm. In Computer Science, algorithms are written in programming languages and operate on data structures.

### Algorithm Examples
- Finding the fastest route in a GPS navigation system
- Navigating an airplane or car (cruise control)
- Search engine queries
- Sorting data, such as sorting movies by rating

## Data Structures and Algorithms Together
DSA is about finding efficient ways to store and retrieve data, perform operations on data, and solve specific problems. Understanding DSA helps in:
- Deciding the best data structure or algorithm for a situation
- Making programs faster and more memory efficient
- Approaching and solving complex problems systematically

## Where is DSA Needed?
DSA is used in virtually every software system, such as:
- Operating Systems
- Database Systems
- Web Applications
- Machine Learning
- Video Games
- Cryptographic Systems
- Data Analysis
- Search Engines

## Theory and Terminology
Key terms and concepts:
- **Algorithm**: Step-by-step instructions to solve a problem.
- **Data Structure**: Organizing data for efficient use.
- **Time Complexity**: Time taken by an algorithm relative to input size.
- **Space Complexity**: Memory used by an algorithm relative to input size.
- **Big O Notation**: Describes the time complexity of an algorithm.
- **Recursion**: Function calling itself.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Solving problems by breaking them into smaller sub-problems.
- **Brute Force**: Trying all possible solutions to find the best one.

## Where to Start?
Begin with learning a data structure and its matching algorithms before moving on to the next. This step-by-step approach helps in understanding complex concepts as you progress.

Ensure you are comfortable with at least one common programming language like JavaScript, C, or Python before starting.

## Next Steps
In the next section, we will explore two algorithms to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers using primitive data structures (two integer variables). One algorithm will use a loop, and the other will use recursion.
