## DSA Full Form

The term DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms in the context of Computer Science.

## What is DSA?

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) refer to the study of methods for organizing and storing data and the design of procedures (algorithms) for solving problems that operate on these data structures.

## How to Learn DSA

The process of learning DSA can be broken down into five parts:

1. Learn at least one programming language.
2. Learn Data Structures.
3. Learn Algorithms.
4. Learn about Time and Space complexities.
5. Practice Problems on DSA.

## Learn Data Structures

Data structures are essential components that help organize and store data efficiently in computer memory. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

### Array

An array is a linear data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type. Elements are allocated contiguous memory, allowing for constant-time access.

#### Operations on Array:

- Traversal: Iterating through the elements of an array.
- Insertion: Adding an element to the array at a specific index.
- Deletion: Removing an element from the array at a specific index.
- Searching: Finding an element in the array by its value or index.

#### Types of Arrays:

- One-dimensional array: A simple array with a single dimension.
- Multidimensional array: An array with multiple dimensions, such as a matrix.

#### Applications of Array:

- Storing data in a sequential manner.
- Implementing queues, stacks, and other data structures.
- Representing matrices and tables.

# Manual Notes:

# C++ Memory Management and Function Calls

This `README.md` file provides an overview of memory management and function calls in C++.

## Pointers

* All pointers of all types take the same size of 8 bytes.

## Heap Memory

* Declaration in heap memory in C++ is done using the `new` keyword.
* For an array: `a = new int[5];`
* For a structure: `a = new rectangle;`

## Function Calls

* Call by value in function is not suitable for changing the value of actual parameters.
* Call by address is used when we have to change the value of actual parameters.
* Call by reference: the formal parameters becomes the nickname for actual parameters, thus can change the value of actual parameters.

## Returning Array

* When returning an array from a function, use a pointer:
```c++
int* fun(int n) {
    int* p;
    p = new int[n];
    return (p);
}

int main() {
    int* A;
    A = fun(5);
}
```
## Arrays

* Arrays are always passed by address, never by value.
* On passing array to a function, we can use `*` instead of `[]`.
* Array cannot be passed as call by value to a function, but while using array inside the structure, we can use call by value.

## Classes

* For creating objects of class in C++, the syntax is `classname objectname;`.
* Use `::` as scope resolution to define the function outside the class.
* For destroying or removing heap memory, use a destructor: `~class name(){}.`
* While changing the class to template class, we have to mention the template type after scope resolution also: `template <class T> class Arithmetic{};`.

## Memory Allocation

* Array is created in heap or in stack.
* Linked list is always created in heap.
